# netdi

A dependency injection container for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) projects that is inspired by the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) DI container. It is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use.

✅ .NET-style service registration with different lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient)
✅ Constructor injection with decorators
✅ Type-safe dependency resolution
